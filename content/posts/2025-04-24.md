In April we are once again having a couple of events in the same week:

* An evening pub event on Thu 24th April (this event)
* A daytime coffee event on Fri 25th April (see other Meetup Event)

Our intent is to cater to as wide a range of preferences as possible. Please choose the one that suits you the best!
