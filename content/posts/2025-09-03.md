# Synopsis

Want a Squeezable / Modern / Helpful / Wide Language? Choose Four 

Rust, a language born in 2006, may now be in your kettle, your browser, and your AI. Somehow it's managed to do this whilst still being the "most admired" programming language.

Come along to find out what "Squeezable / Modern / Helpful / Wide" mean in practice, and why, in Rust, you can do hard things and still have a good time (eventually).

# Bio

<a href="https://www.houseofmoran.com"><i class="fa-solid fa-person"></i> Mike Moran</a> is a Principal Engineer at Skyscanner. He has been programming in some form since the early 90's, and on the Internet since 1994, when he created a website for Comet Shoemaker-Levy hitting Jupiter.

This was all before search-engines existed so you can't prove him wrong. Since that time he's worked in startups, scale-ups and behemoths, been a manager and an IC, and helped Skyscanner reach Unicorn status.

He's fallen in and out of love with multiple (computer) languages so knows how to spot a fad. His programming in Rust started in 2019, and he's been running the [Rust and Friends Edinburgh Meetup](https://rustandfriends.org) since 2020.
