Rust is growing, increasingly powered by its many and varied application areas. This group is about catering to the interests of people who just want to apply it, as well as those who want to learn more about the core language itself.

This is a small pub get-together on these themes. The intent is we at least have one of these every 2 months, occasionally interspersed / replaced with some talks.
