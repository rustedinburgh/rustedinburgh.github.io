Tonight we’ll be hearing from:

[David Wood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidtwco/) on "Extending Rust’s notions of sizedness". From David:
* "All of Rust’s types either implement the Sized trait, and so have a statically known size during compilation, or do not, and are assumed to have a size computed at runtime. However, this misses out two categories of type: types whose size is unknown during compilation but is a runtime constant, and types whose size can never be known. The former is a prerequisite to stable scalable vector types and the latter is needed to unblock extern types. This talk explores the ongoing “Hierarchy of Sized types” efforts and how the language is being extended to improve support for exotically sized types."
* David leads the Rust team at Arm, is co-lead of the upstream Rust compiler team and a board member of the Rust Foundation.

[Tiago Santos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiago-santos-1b04a5118/) and [Eren Şimşek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cafer-eren-simsek/) on "Rust in Space at Spire":
* [Spire](https://spire.com/) designs, builds and operates the world’s largest multipurpose satellite constellation. Tiago and Eren will introduce us to this domain and then go into how and where they use Rust.
* Tiago is a Software Engineering Director at Spire and Eren is a Software Engineer at Spire.

We are generously hosted once again within [Perks new Edinburgh offices](https://www.travelperk.com/uk/edinburgh-uk/), who will also be providing 🍕and 🍻!
