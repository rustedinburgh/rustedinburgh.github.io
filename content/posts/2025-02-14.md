(This is a rescheduled instance of the event we previously had planned for January but had to cancel due to weather warnings)

Welcome to Rust + Coffee ðŸ˜€. This is intended as a choice for people who want to get together to chat/learn about Rust but can't make an evening session or just don't want to meet in a pub.

This is totally optional, but: it can be helpful to bring your laptop along if you'd like some help. There is no absolutely requirement to, but since this is during the day and in a cafe it makes a bit easier to do this.
