It's time for some talks again! Tonight we'll be hearing from:

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-stafford-72a8562a/"><i class="fa-solid fa-person"></i> Chris Stafford</a> on *Escaping Node and React: Powering the web with Rust*. From Chris:  
  > "I've been writing web applications in Javascript since 1998, and I'm sick of it. React and server-side rendering is turning the web into an unmaintainable nightmare. Can Rust save us from ourselves? Possibly not, but maybe you can get an educational talk out of me trying it."

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugotunius/"><i class="fa-solid fa-person"></i> Hugo Tunius</a> on *Escaping coloured functions hell using inversion*. From Hugo:  
  > "Sync or Async? Tokio, Async-std, Smol, or Glommio? How about all of them? This talk will show you how to side-step these choices while writing code that is easier to test extend, and port across runtimes. Learn a design approach that frees your core logic from runtime dependencies, allowing you to leverage any ecosystem without getting locked in."
  > "I stumbled upon Rust in 2017 and have been hooked ever since. For the last 3+ years I've been working professionally with Rust building live streaming infrastructure at [Lookback](https://www.lookback.com/)."
