In January we're having a couple of events in the same week:

* An evening pub event on Tue the 21st (see other Meetup Event)
* A daytime coffee event on Fri the 24th (this event)

Our intent is to cater to as wide a range of preferences as possible. Please choose the one that suits you the best!

This is totally optional, but: it can be helpful to bring your laptop along if you'd like some help. There is no absolutely requirement to, but since this is during the day and in a cafe it makes a bit easier to do this.
