This was presented by Mark Smith:
> "MongoDB have been working hard on adding Rust as a fully
supported client language for MongoDB, and the new driver
reached beta this month. Mark Smith will run you through
the basics of how to use it and how it was developed,
including (maybe) interesting techniques used to support
tokio, async-std and non-async programming approaches"
