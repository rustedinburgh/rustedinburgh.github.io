This was presented by Mikhail Voronov.

The
<a href="https://fluence.network">Fluence</a>
<a href="https://github.com/fluencelabs/fce">Compute Engine</a>
is intended to run multi-module WebAssembly applications
with a shared-nothing linking scheme and with
interface-types support.

This talk focussed on:
* Why the interface-types proposal is essential for all ecosystems using WASM
* Why Rust is one of the most suitable languages for any projects using WASM
* The FCE architecture itself
* Support for interface-types in the <a href="https://github.com/fluencelabs/rust-sdk">Fluence Rust SDK </a>.
