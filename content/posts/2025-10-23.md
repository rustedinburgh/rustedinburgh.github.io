Time for some 🍁chat about Rust!

As is now usual, we have a couple of events in the same week to cater to different preferences:
* 🍻 An evening pub event on Thu 23rd (this event)
* ☕️ A daytime coffee event on Fri 24th (see [other Meetup Event](https://www.meetup.com/rust-and-friends/events/311501249/))

Please feel free to come to both 🙂
