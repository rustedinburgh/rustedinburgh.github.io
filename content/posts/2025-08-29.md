It's August in Edinburgh. It's busy 🏃. It's sweltering 💦. But still: there is always space for Rust 🦀!

As is now usual, we have a couple of events in the same week to cater to different preferences:
* 🍻 An evening pub event on Thu 28th (see [other Meetup Event](https://www.meetup.com/rust-and-friends/events/310438757/))
* ☕️ A daytime coffee event on Fri 29th (this event)

Please feel free to come to both 🙂
