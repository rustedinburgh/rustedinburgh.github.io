It's August in Edinburgh. It's busy 🏃. It's sweltering 💦. But still: there is always space for Rust 🦀!

As is now usual, we have a couple of events in the same week to cater to different preferences:
* 🍻 An evening pub event on Thu 28th (this event)
* ☕️ A daytime coffee event on Fri 29th (see [other Meetup Event](https://www.meetup.com/rust-and-friends/events/310438764/))

Please feel free to come to both 🙂
