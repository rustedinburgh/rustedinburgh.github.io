This was presented by Benedict Gaster.

Benedict talked about "Audio Anywhere", a framework for
working with audio plugins that are compiled once and run
anywhere. He introduced a desktop example; including the
use of Faust for DSP, lightweight Web-views for GUIs, and
Rust as a hosting language.

At the heart of Audio Anywhere is an audio engine whose
Digital Signal Processing (DSP) components are written in
Faust and deployed with WebAssembly.

He described his groups modifications to the Faust
compiler, utilizing Rust as an intermediate language to
provide access to auto-vectorization of WebAssembly
(128-SIMD). A number of example modules were discussed,
demonstrating the utility of the framework.
