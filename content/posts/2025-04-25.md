Welcome to Rust + Coffee ðŸ˜€. This is intended as a choice for people who want to get together to chat/learn about Rust but can't make an evening session or just don't want to meet in a pub.

In April we're having a couple of events in the same week:
* A daytime coffee event on Fri the 25th (this event)
* An evening pub event on Thu the 24th (see other Meetup Event)

We had a great turn-out last time, but ended up still a nice relaxed chat. This time we are trying a different venue (Machina Coffee); the last venue was great, but it's good to try out new places.

This is totally optional, but: it can be helpful to bring your laptop along if you'd like some help. There is no absolutely requirement to, but since this is during the day and in a cafe it makes a bit easier to do this.
