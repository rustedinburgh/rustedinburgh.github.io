Something for people just getting started as well as
wanting to go a bit deeper:
* <a href="https://davidtw.co/"><i class="fa-solid fa-person"></i> David Wood</a>: "Touring Rustc: Declarative Macros" (<a href="slides/2022-12-01/2022-11-meetup-decl-macro.pdf"><i class="fa-solid fa-person-chalkboard"></i> slides</a>)
* <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-bownes-5178a4100/"><i class="fa-solid fa-person"></i> Richard Bownes</a>: "Extending Python with Rust - A friendly introduction to compiled languages." (<a href="slides/2022-12-01/rustmeetup.pdf"><i class="fa-solid fa-person-chalkboard"></i> slides</a>)

We also gave away a free copy of the excellent <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0BHLDMFDQ">"Zero To Production In Rust"</a> by Luca Palmieri which is also a great book for getting started in your journey with Rust.

We were generously hosted this evening within Huawei's Edinburgh Research Centre, where David works in the Programming Languages Group.
