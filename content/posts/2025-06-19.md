In June we are once again having a couple of events in the same week:

* An evening pub event on Thu 19th June (this event)
* A daytime coffee event on Fri 20th June (see other [Meetup Event](/posts/2025-06-20/))

Our intent is to cater to as wide a range of preferences as possible. Please choose the one that suits you the best!
