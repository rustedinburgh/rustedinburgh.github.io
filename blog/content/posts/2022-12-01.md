We also gave away a free copy of the excellent

    >"Zero To Production In Rust"</a
>
by Luca Palmieri which is also a great book for getting
started in your journey with Rust.

We were generously hosted this evening within Huawei's
Edinburgh Research Centre, where David works in the
Programming Languages Group.
