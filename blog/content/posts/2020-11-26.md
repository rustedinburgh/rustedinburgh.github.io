This was presented by Vladimir Komendantskiy.

Polymesh is a blockchain for financial securities. It is
built on the Substrate framework written in Rust. Around
this time the valuation of all projects built on top of
Substrate reached $5 billion.

Vladimir described what blockchain securities are and gave
examples of operations on them in Rust: settlement,
corporate actions, and confidential transactions.

He showed how a WASM runtime can be constructed on
Substrate and how it is upgraded on the fly without
restarting the network nodes. He talked about the
zero-knowledge cryptography behind confidential
transactions (MERCAT) and showed smart contracts written
in Ink! (a Rust-based DSL).
