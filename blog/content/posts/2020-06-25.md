This was presented by Neil Gall:

> "My experience learning Rust to build an embedded control
system. A quick tour of the technologies used, the
problems overcome and my experience diving into the Rust
ecosystem for the first time to build a Raspberry Pi
powered greenhouse irrigator - dubbed Pirrigator -
resulting in a fine crop of tomatoes guaranteed free from
race conditions and memory errors."
