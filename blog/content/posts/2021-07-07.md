<p>
    Rust was pretty hot around then, with many big names
    putting their support behind it. We asked: Is Rust now
    "Crossing the Chasm"? More pragmatically, how can we best
    apply it in our day jobs?
</p>
<p>
    In this Meetup we heard from these Special Guests who've
    successfully applied Rust in their own companies:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Niall Dalton from
    <a href="https://seaplane.io/">seaplane.io</a>
    </li>
    <li>
    Luca Palmieri from
    <a href="https://truelayer.com/">truelayer.com</a> (also
    author of
    <a href="https://www.zero2prod.com/">zero2prod.com</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
    Michael Fey, and others, from
    <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We also opened it up for general Q/A about how we might
    get the best out of Rust ourselves.
